# Mars_weather_Challenge

## Data Scrapping Challenge 

### Overview:

This Challenge involves data scrapping and analysis of data based on data collected by NASA's curiosity rover. It is divided into 2 parts which are:

1. Mars news articles from the webite
[Mars news site](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html)
Result: [Mars Weather NEWS](https://github.com/asifshahzad-92/Mars_weather_Challenge/blob/main/mars_news.json)

3. Weather data scraping and analysis
[Mars Temperature Data Site](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html)
Result: [Curiosity Rover Data](https://github.com/asifshahzad-92/Mars_weather_Challenge/blob/main/mars_data.csv)

### Data Analysis:

Analyzed the data set to answer the following questions:

1. How many months exist on Mars?

2. How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?

3. What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:

![Coldest and Warmest Months on Mars](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f9c63b6-967a-474e-b9e7-79bf6e25bb9c)


    * Find the average the minimum daily temperature for all of the months.

    * Plot the results as a bar chart.

5. Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:

![Lowest and Highest Pressure on Mars](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ff4ec31-0f3c-4f39-ad2b-d3adf75383dd)


    * Find the average the daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.

    * Plot the results as a bar chart.

7. About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year?

   There are roughly 685 Earth days in a Martain year based on the temperature variation from Curiosity Reover Temperature variation Data.


    * Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.

As we can see from visually plotting temperature data of subset 315 to 1000 there are roughly 685 Days on Earth elapsed that Mars circles the sun once (year).

    * Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.
