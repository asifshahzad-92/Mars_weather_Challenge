3. What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:

    * Find the average the minimum daily temperature for all of the months.

    * Plot the results as a bar chart.
   

4. Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:

    * Find the average the daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.

    * Plot the results as a bar chart.

5. About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:

    * Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.

    * Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.
